# fibonacci-methods

The following project was coded in Java and demonstrates knowledge of 
recursive and iterative methods.

1. class *FibonacciSeq*: The following program was written in both iterative and recursive approaches.
These methods print out the ùëõùë°‚Ñé Fibonacci element (not the whole sequence). The efficiency of the two
methods in terms of Time Complexity and type the Big-O notation are written into the code as comments.
Both approaches are printed in the main method.

2. class *fibMethods*: Based on the class above, I further developed a program that adds each Fibonacci
number(starting from 0, 1) to a list(an array), and can perform remove, ifContains, grab, and
numItems operations. These operations are explained below and in the code.
* add(int item): adds a number to the list (allow to add duplicates)
* remove(int item): removes the item (if exists) from the list
* ifContains(int item): checks if the item exists in the list
* grab(): randomly draws a number from the list without removing
* numItems(): prints out the number of unique items in the list (without duplicates)
